Call to worship:
So we bow as we enter the throne room
And we cast ourselves down at Your feet
We cry holy, thou art holy, there is none like thee.
In Your presence is where we must be

Praise
1) I will lift up my voice
I’ll joyfully sing

Not for what you have done for me
But for whom you are

You are the reason I sing
Melody in my heart

You are the song that I sing
I’ll praise You Lord

He reigns
Forevermore

2) Every praise is to our God
Every word of worship in one accord

Every praise (2x) is to our God

3) I won't be silent my God is alive,
How could I keep it inside

Praise the Lord oh my soul

4)Generations after generations
Keep praising You yet no word sums You up

Then I asked the Lord, what name fits You
And He said "Yah"

Yah, the Hallowed One
Yah, the Holy One
Yahweh, the King of Zion

5) My Daddy my Daddy
Your baby is singing, I will be singing

And dancing and shouting for the rest of eternity

Only You, only You

6) I've got joy joy joy
Joy overflow in my life

7) Jehovah eeee, Jehovah aaah

Worship:
You are mighty (Olorun Agbaye oo)
